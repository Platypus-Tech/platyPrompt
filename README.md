# platyPrompt

## About

This is a special command line for Platypus OS. It is going to be one of 3 or 4 command line interfaces, with the others being:

  1. Bash shell
  2. CROSH, which nobody knows how to use, due to a lack of documentation
  3. The Minecraft one, Brigadier

This one is going to have good documentation, unlike CROSH. (If there is good, simple documentation on CROSH, tell me please? I hate giving bad press).

## Use

Logging in, simple actions, text editing, scripting, booting up the system. Basically, all the important stuff.

## Notice

*This is in beta. If it crashes/goes "KA-BOOM", it's not my fault.*

## Errorrrrs

There are going to be errors. It's inevitable. So if you find them, change the code, report in issues, do a fork, branch, whatever. Just fix them. 
# Thanks! :)
